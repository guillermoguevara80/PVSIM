		<p> The ForcastApp lets you estimate GHI, DNI and DHI for the following 7 days. 
		Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is the total amount 
		of shortwave radiation received from above by a surface horizontal to the ground.
		Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI): amount of solar radiation received per unit area by a surface 
		that is always held perpendicular (or normal) to the rays that come in a straight line 
		from the direction of the sun at its current position in the sky. 
		Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) is the amount of radiation received per 
		unit area by a surface (not subject to any shade or shadow) that does not arrive on a 
		direct path from the sun, but has been scattered by molecules and particles in the 
		atmosphere and comes equally from all directions<style="margin: 10px ;"/p>
	{% elif simu.type == "Summer&Winter Irradiance" %}
		<p> The IrradianceApp lets you estimate GHI and POA for a certain date and hour. 
		Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is the total amount 
		of shortwave radiation received from above by a surface horizontal to the ground.
		Plane Of Array (POA) is the irradiance captured by a plane or PV pannel with a certain tilt angle.
		<style="margin: 10px ;"/p>	
	{% elif simu.type == "Sun Path" %}
		<p> Sun path, sometimes also called day arc, refers to the daily and seasonal arc-like path that the 
		Sun appears to follow across the sky as the Earth rotates and orbits the Sun. 
		The Sun's path affects the length of daytime experienced and amount of daylight received along a 
		certain latitude during a given season.
		The relative position of the Sun is a major factor in the heat gain of buildings and in the performance 
		of solar energy systems.[1] Accurate location-specific knowledge of sun path and climatic conditions 
		is essential for economic decisions about solar collector area, orientation, landscaping, summer shading, 
		and the cost-effective use of solar trackers.
